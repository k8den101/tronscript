tronscript is a IT persons best friend  look at the read me please

"Tron is a script that "fights for the User."

The goal is to automate ~87% of the tedious work in getting a badly-running Windows system back on its feet (clicking "next" in AV scan windows, etc); with much left to the discretion of the tech.

Tron is built with heavy reliance on community input and updated regularly.

Tron is NOT a system optimization or "baseline" script.

Tron is intended for use by PC Technicians who are already familiar with basic troubleshooting and command-line operation. It is not intended for use by people with no basic troubleshooting knowledge.

Read the instructions."
